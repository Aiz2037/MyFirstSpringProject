This project demonstrates my skills to develop backend development project which uses Java,Spring,MapStruct and other libraries for server-side logic, databases, and application programming interfaces (APIs). 
I called this project as "School Management System", where this project allows user to book room, view available room for class session in their school.
I created 4 folders to represent "entity", "controller", "service" and "repository" layer. For data storage, H2 database is used for this project to store all the details about the user and also the book room.

Entity layer:

I created DTO folder that contains DTO class which provides seemless data transfer between layers, and also DataForMap folder for mapping operation between DTO fields and Entity fields.

UserDTO class:
